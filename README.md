I'm Luke Myers, a second year Computer Science student at UC San Diego.

### Android

While with FRC Team 980, I developed **ThunderScout**, a FRC scouting application that follows Google's Material Design principles.

## Extracurricular

### Minecraft

I've also been running Minecraft servers off and on since 2013. My latest one, *TheVortex SMP,* launched on December 15th.
